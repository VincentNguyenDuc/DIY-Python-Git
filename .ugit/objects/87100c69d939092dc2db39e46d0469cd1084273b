- ugit is not exactly Git, but it shares the important ideas of Git. ugit is way shorter and doesn't implement irrelevant features.

## Technologies

- Python
- pip
- git

## Project Objectives

- Built Git from scratch
- Worked with python packaging system
- Set up a virtual environment for development
- Used SHA-1 for implement "the object database"
