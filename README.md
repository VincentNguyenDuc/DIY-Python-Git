## General Information

- In this project, I will try to implement a Git-like version control system called "Î¼git" from scratch but using Python

- Ugit is not exactly Git, but it shares the important ideas of Git. ugit is way shorter and doesn't implement irrelevant features.

## Technologies

- Python
- pip
- git

## Project Objectives

- Built Git from scratch
- Worked with python packaging system
- Set up a virtual environment for development
- Used SHA-1 for implement "the object database"
- Deepened my understanding into Git
- Tried implemented this in a different language

## Set Up

- Install pip following [instruction](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- Clone [this repository](https://github.com/VincentNguyenDuc/DIY-Python-Git.git)
- Within the DIY-Python-Git directory, select the Python interpreter (where pip installed)
- Run:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Commands

```bash

# object id: the hash code of the commit / branch
# refs: reference to branch name / tags / object id

# initialize a ugit repository
ugit init

# print contents from object id
ugit cat-file {object_id}

# commit
ugit commit -m 'message'

# tag
ugit tag {name} {object_id}(optional - use for specific commit / if not available then tag the closet commit)

# List all commits from the chosen commit to the beginning of version history. If not specific object id or refs, then list all commits to the current HEAD
ugit log {object_id / refs}(optional)

# check out a branch or a specific commit
ugit checkout {object_id / refs}

# create a branch from a commit, default to the current HEAD
ugit branch {name} {start_point}(optional) 

# show all branches
ugit branch

# visualize the commits history 
ugit k

# show the information of the current branch
ugit status
```
